## WEBSITE_CORRECTION_REPORT.md

### 1. Summary
Made **minimal, content-only corrections** on the landing page (`index.html`) to reduce ambiguity and align claims with plan limits and non-medical positioning. Changes were limited to:
- Clarifying caregiver-sharing limits on the Free plan
- Softening absolute onboarding language
- Removing health-outcome phrasing
- Adding a 1-sentence non-medical disclaimer inline on the landing page where pediatrician/PDF visit context appears
- Scoping “complete care history” to logged records only

No new features were added. No legal disclaimers were removed.

### 2. Change Log (REQUIRED)

#### Change 1 — Pediatrician context disclaimer (landing page)
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Section / heading**: “What is Scoopy Log?”
- **Original text**:
  - “...have clarity during pediatric visits. No clutter, no stress.”
- **Updated text**:
  - “...have clarity during pediatric visits. Scoopy Log does not provide medical advice or diagnosis. No clutter, no stress.”
- **Reason**: Adds a short inline disclaimer on the landing page in a section that references pediatric visits, reducing medical-advice implication risk.

#### Change 2 — Health-adjacent wording adjustment (diapers)
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Section / heading**: “How it helps parents” → “Diapers”
- **Original text**:
  - “Keep a record of diaper changes to stay on top of your baby's health.”
- **Updated text**:
  - “Keep a record of diaper changes to stay organized and informed about daily care routines.”
- **Reason**: Removes health-outcome language and replaces it with non-medical, organizational phrasing.

#### Change 3 — Caregiver/sharing clarification (Free plan limits)
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Section / heading**: “Why parents choose Scoopy Log” → “Share with caregivers”
- **Original text**:
  - “Invite partners, grandparents, or nannies to view and contribute to your log.”
- **Updated text**:
  - “Invite partners, grandparents, or nannies to view and contribute to your log (limits apply on the Free plan).”
- **Reason**: Adds a clear qualifier at the first sharing-benefit mention to align expectations with plan limits described later in Pricing.

#### Change 4 — Pediatrician/PDF context disclaimer (export benefit)
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Section / heading**: “Why parents choose Scoopy Log” → “Export and share”
- **Original text**:
  - “Generate clean PDF reports to share with your pediatrician or keep for your records.”
- **Updated text**:
  - “Generate clean PDF reports to share with your pediatrician or keep for your records. Scoopy Log does not provide medical advice or diagnosis.”
- **Reason**: Adds an inline, 1-sentence non-medical disclaimer directly in a section that references sharing PDFs with a pediatrician.

#### Change 5 — “Nothing to set up” absolute language softened
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Section / heading**: “Simple by design” → “Designed for everyday life”
- **Original text**:
  - “Log moments as they happen. Nothing to set up, nothing to manage. The app stays out of your way.”
- **Updated text**:
  - “Log moments as they happen. Minimal setup—no complex onboarding. The app stays out of your way.”
- **Reason**: Replaces absolute “nothing to set up/manage” with a calmer, truthful version that allows minimal onboarding.

#### Change 6 — “Complete care history” scoped to logged data only + pediatrician disclaimer
- **File**: `index.html`
- **Section / heading**: “Captain's Log”
- **Original text**:
  - “Export your complete care history as a professional PDF report.”
  - “Perfect for pediatrician visits, care transitions, or your own records. The Captain's Log includes all logged activities organized by date.”
- **Updated text**:
  - “Export a complete history of your logged records as a professional PDF report.”
  - “Perfect for pediatrician visits, care transitions, or your own records. Scoopy Log does not provide medical advice or diagnosis. The Captain's Log includes all logged activities organized by date.”
- **Reason**: Removes absolute/broad “complete care history” wording by scoping it to logged records; adds a short inline non-medical disclaimer within the pediatrician-visit context on the landing page.

### 3. Compliance Check

- **Matches app behavior (as described on the site)**: **Improved**
  - Sharing benefits now include an explicit Free-plan limitation at first mention.
  - “Nothing to set up” wording is softened to allow minimal onboarding.

- **Avoids medical claims**: **Improved**
  - Health-outcome phrasing in the diapers feature was removed.
  - A 1-sentence non-medical disclaimer is now present **on the landing page** in pediatrician/PDF contexts.

- **Avoids misleading absolute language**: **Improved**
  - “Nothing to set up, nothing to manage” and “complete care history” were corrected to scoped, non-absolute phrasing.

- **Items not changed (not requested)**:
  - The landing page still displays “4.9 rating” and “Join thousands of parents who trust Scoopy Log every day.” These were not modified because they were **not part of the explicitly requested corrections**.
